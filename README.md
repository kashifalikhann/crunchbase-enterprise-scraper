## Cookie-Based Cloudflare Bypass

The most reliable way to bypass Cloudflare: **upload your browser's Crunchbase cookies once daily**.

### How it works

1. Open `https://www.crunchbase.com` in your **regular desktop browser** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
2. If Cloudflare shows a challenge, solve it (one-time — you're a real human)
3. Use a cookie export extension (e.g. "Cookie-Editor" for Chrome) to export **all cookies**
4. Upload the exported JSON array to the Actor's key-value store with key `CRUNCHBASE_COOKIES`

### Where to upload

Storage → Key-Value Store → (your actor's default store) → **Add Record**

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `CRUNCHBASE_COOKIES` | Paste the full JSON array from Cookie-Editor |

The actor reads these cookies on every run and injects them into Playwright's browser context. Crunchbase sees a valid Cloudflare clearance token and serves data directly — no proxy needed, no CAPTCHA for the scraper.

> **Tip**: `cf_clearance` cookies typically last 24h. Upload fresh cookies daily before your scraping run. The actor logs a clear warning when cookies are expired.

## How It Works

1. If you provide a Crunchbase API key — uses the official API v4 (fastest, most reliable)
2. No API key — loads Crunchbase cookies from KV store (if available), launches a headless Playwright Chromium browser with stealth anti-detection:
   - Injects uploaded cookies for instant Cloudflare clearance
   - Blocks Cloudflare Turnstile and challenge scripts at the network level
   - Overrides `navigator.webdriver`, sets realistic viewport/locale/timezone
   - Waits for `__NEXT_DATA__` to appear before extracting
   - Reuses browser session across requests for efficiency
3. Extracts structured data from `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON embedded in the page
4. Falls back to official API if browser fails (when API key is configured)

## Performance

- ~10-20 seconds per company with Playwright browser
- Batch processing: 50-100 companies per run
- Browser is auto-launched at start and reused across all requests
- Automatic retry with backoff for transient failures

## Technical Details

- Built with Crawlee + Playwright for reliable browser automation
- Anti-detection: custom user-agent, viewport, navigator overrides, script blocking
- Runs on Apify infrastructure with global proxy support
- Dockerized with `apify/actor-node-playwright-chrome` base image
- TypeScript with full type definitions for all data structures
